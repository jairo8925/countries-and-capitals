- Update option to be red or green according to user's answer (maybe)
- <s>Remove capital city from list once used</s>
- Add a timer
- <s>Add picture of capital city's location on Earth</s>
- Add sound to game (also a text-to-speech)
- Add start and reset button
- Add input for number of questions to solve (probably not)
- Add information about capital city/country as a popup on map (use leaflet's popup)
- Pan camera to marker (need to learn about hooks)
- <s>Add country flag next to option</s>
